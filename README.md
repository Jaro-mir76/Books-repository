# Books-repository

This is small application using GoogleBooks API for searching books in their repository.

Now you can choose to search in text or author name, results can be also filtered by language.

I've changed approach to show covers in high resolution. I'm using parameter not described in Google'a API, however I've already noticed they don't have consistent data and sometimes instead of cover you get something else.

Finally there is my home made "pull up to load more" gesture because I didn't find such among Apple's.
