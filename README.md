# Books-repository

This is small application using GoogleBooks API for searching books in their repository.

Key functions:
> free text search,
  - filter by author,
  - filter by language,
> check basing info:
  - author,
  - date of publishing,
  - short description,
  - see cover in high resolution. 

Additional info - I've decided to use discovered by my trick to show covers in high resolution, however I've already noticed they don't have consistent data and sometimes instead of cover you get something else or nothing.
I've created my home made "pull up to load more" gesture because I didn't find such among Apple's.
I've added also my own ID to the records to fix problem with displaying because Google either don't have consistant data or give results covering the same books.
